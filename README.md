I was working about design patterns and I decided to make it public. I've answered the questions given in the book. <br />

## What is Design Pattern

> In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.
